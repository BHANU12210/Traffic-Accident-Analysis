# Traffic-Accident-Analysis
Traffic Accident Analysis – Identify Patterns &amp; Hotspots
This project focuses on analyzing traffic accident data to identify patterns, trends, and geographical hotspots using Python-based data analytics and visualization techniques.

## 📁 Dataset
The dataset is based on real-world traffic accident data, such as the [US Accidents dataset from Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sobhanmoosavi/us-accidents). It includes information on:
- Time and location of accidents
- Weather conditions
- Road types and visibility
- Geographic coordinates (latitude and longitude)
- Accident severity and more

> 🗂️ **File:** `accidentdata.csv`  
> 📅 **Date range:** [Specify if known]  
> 📍 **Location coverage:** [e.g., USA]

## 🧪 Project Goals

- Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Identify accident patterns based on:
  - Time of day, day of week
  - Weather conditions and visibility
  - Light conditions (Day/Night)
  - Geographic distribution
- Visualize accident-prone hotspots on maps

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies

- **Python** (3.10+)
- **Pandas** – data manipulation
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn** – data visualization
- **VS Code** – development
- *(Optional)* Power BI / Plotly for map-based visualizations

## 📊 Analysis Highlights

- 🌦️ Effect of weather conditions (Rain, Fog, Snow) on accident severity
- 🌙 Day vs Night accident distributions
- 🕒 Hourly and weekly trends of accident frequency
- 📍 Geographic heatmaps using `Latitude` and `Longitude`
